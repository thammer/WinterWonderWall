WinterWonderWall license
------------------------

WinterWonderWall consists of hand-drawn images, a video, and source
code (a "sketch") written in the Processing programming
language.

You are free to use the sketch in public performances. If there is a
natural place to give credits, during the performance or in a written
program or similar, we would appreciate if you give credits to our
work, for instance with a statement like "... based on
WinterWonderWall by Kari Tonette and Thomas Hammer from
www.thammer.net". We would also appreciate being informed of the
performance. If you send us a few lines of text and a photo of the
performance, we'll include it on the project page at www.thammer.net.
