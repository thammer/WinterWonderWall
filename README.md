# WinterWonderWall #

WinterWonderWall is a live visual performance created by Kari Tonette Andreassen and [Thomas Hammer](http://www.thammer.net) for a Christmas concert with the [KorX](http://www.korx.net) choir in "Sondre Slagen Kirke" (Sondre Slagen Church, Tonsberg, Norway) December 2012.

The live visuals were projected on the end wall in the church, which is approximately 20 meters wide and 20 meters tall, a white stone wall with a [beautiful woven altarpiece](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=s√∏ndre+slagen+kirke&um=1&tbm=isch).

## System requirements ##

The sketch requires [Processing v2.0b7](http://www.processing.org) and will not run on earlier versions of Processing.

The sketch has been tested on a laptop running Windows 7 x64 and on a MacBook Pro (early 2011) running OSX 10.6.

Before running the sketch from within the Processing environment, make sure you increase the memory allocated to the sketch, as the default 123 MB is too little.

The recommended memory to allocate is 512 MB. In the Processing environment, do File | Preferences | Increase maximum available memory to 512 MB.

## Usage ##

By default, the sketch runs in demo-mode, with one standard (not fullscreen) window showing the main sketch and one window with controllers. The light is projected on a picture of a vowen altar piece.

The sketch can also run in normal (presenter) mode, fullscreen, controlled either by a MIDI controller or by the keyboard. The image of the altar piece is not used when in this mode, as the altar piece is already on the wall IRL.

When setting up the performance for the first time, the masks needs to be set correctly according to the projector position in relation to the wall and the altar piece. Hit the "P" key to define the black outline wall mask, click around the outline of the wall, and hit "P" again to save the mask. Hit the "L" key to define the white overline mask (used for the light on Jesus on the altar piece), click around the outline of the Jesus figure, and hit "L" again to save the mask. When defining masks, it might be helpful to show a little bit of the global white light overlay (MIDI CC 87 or keyboard "6 Y H N").
